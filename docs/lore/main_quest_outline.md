## The Central Crisis: The Missing King

### The Situation
The Empire is falling apart. The King has been missing for **40 years**, and his absence has created:

1. **Political Turmoil in Falkenhaften**
   - Factions claiming to have the king's heir/ancestor
   - Competing narratives pushing for power
   - Noble houses positioning for the throne

2. **Escalating External Threats**
   - **Ghost pirates and drowned undead** - Maritime horrors plaguing the coasts
   - **Southern desert hordes** - Bloodthirsty invaders pushing north
   - General chaos as the empire's grip weakens

### The Truth (Hidden from player initially)
The King didn't die or get assassinated. He **ran away** seeking immortality.

- 40 years ago, he traveled to the **elven lands**
- He was searching for a legendary **immortality elixir**
- He found it in a deep dungeon
- He got what he wanted - **but became trapped**
- He's still alive, unable to escape
