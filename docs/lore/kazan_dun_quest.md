## The Inciting Incident

### Balon Ironbeard's Death
- **Balon Ironbeard**, the dwarven leader, was killed recently
- Died during the **5th skirmish over the Bridge** against the Goblins
- His body was **taken by the goblins** (critical plot point)
- This happened approximately **one week ago**

### Prospector Gralmir
- Balon's **blood brother**
- Primary quest giver for this arc
- Quote: *"Balon was killed last week, during our 5th skirmish over the Bridge with the Goblins."*
- Fears the succession crisis will tear the clans apart
- Personally prefers engineering and prospecting over combat
- Does NOT want the knife-fight succession path

---

## The Succession Crisis

The dwarven clans are **split on how to determine the next ruler**:

### Path A: The Heir Legitimacy Route
**Faction Goal:** Secure Balon's wife as rightful heir

- Balon's wife is **pregnant, due any day**
- For her claim to be legitimate, they must possess the **Necklace of the Fathers**

#### The Necklace of the Fathers
- Ancient tribal necklace passed down for centuries
- **Whittled from the bones** of the first great beast that fed the great dwarf tribes long ago
- Symbol of legitimate rule and connection to ancestors
- Current location: Unknown (quest objective)

### Path B: The Ancient Rite Route
**Faction Goal:** Invoke the traditional power succession

- Ancient dwarven rite where a **challenger must knife fight the oldest male of the ruling clan**
- For the rite to be legitimate, **Shadow Stone blades** must be present
- This path would likely force Gralmir into the fight (he doesn't want this)

#### Shadow Stone Blades
- Required artifacts for the knife-fight succession ritual
- Made from Shadow Stone material (connected to goblin plot?)
- Current location: Unknown (quest objective)

## The Goblin Threat

### Chieftain Grukthak
- **Cunning goblin leader**
- Orchestrating a larger scheme beyond typical goblin raids
- Has already escalated conflict by killing Balon and taking his body

### The Shadowstone Artifact
- Ancient artifact hidden **deep within the mines**
- Ability: **Amplifies dark magic**
- Grukthak's primary objective

### Grukthak's Master Plan
1. **Harness the Shadowstone** to elevate his status among goblin tribes
2. **Form alliance with a malevolent entity** seeking to spread darkness
3. **Empower goblin forces** into a conquering army
4. **Take Aberdeen** - the large walled city nearby
5. Expand goblin dominion across nearby lands

### Immediate Threat: The Dark Ritual
- Grukthak intends to **consume Balon's flesh** in a perverse goblin dark magic ritual
- Goal: Gain Balon's **courage and strength**
- This ritual is time-sensitive - creates urgency for the player

---

## Quest Objectives (Player Perspective)

### Primary Goals
1. **Recover Balon's Body** - Stop the cannibalistic ritual
2. **Resolve the Succession Crisis** - Choose or influence which path the dwarves take
3. **Stop Grukthak** - Prevent him from obtaining the Shadowstone
4. **Protect Aberdeen** - The stakes if you fail

### Key Items to Find/Secure

- [ ] **Shadow Stone Blades** - For knife-fight ritual path

- Goblins emboldened by lack of imperial response

  - Ghost pirates?
  - Something older awakening due to king's immortality magic?

## Tone Notes

> The smell of forge smoke and old stone fills the great halls of Kazan-Dun,
> but beneath it lingers something else now - the stink of fear. The clans
> mutter in corners, hands on axe-hafts, while below in the dark the goblins
> feast on dwarf-flesh and scheme of empires. The throne sits empty, and
> somewhere a pregnant widow prays her child will be born before the knives
> come out.
